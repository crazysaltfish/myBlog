# PaperWriting
This is a guide for paper writing.
In my own way, 
1. first to check the grammar at https://app.grammarly.com/, 
2. then go to http://www.semdom.org/v4/3.5.8.4 to find synonyms,
3. check the usage frequency of the word that you have chose at https://ludwig.guru/.
Moreover, find academic statement at http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/
